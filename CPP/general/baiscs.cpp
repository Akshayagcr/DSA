   * In the below function we return vector by value i.e. copy of vector v
   * This is preferred approach as we cannot return reference to local objects like vector v
   * As they will go out of scope when the function terminates
   * if we try to use reference in return value to refer local object it will result in compile time error.
   * 
   * 
   * STL containers that are temporary or constructed locally within the function.
   * In C++11 and later, returning by value is often the most efficient approach because modern compilers can optimize 
   * it using copy elision or move semantics.
   * 
   *      When you return an object by value, the compiler will try to use Return Value Optimization (RVO) or 
   *      Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO) to avoid copying the object. These optimizations make the return of 
   *      large objects highly efficient.
   * 
   *      If copy elision is not applied, the compiler will use move semantics to transfer ownership of the object 
   *      (using the move constructor) instead of copying it.
   *      
   *      For small containers (e.g., std::array or trivially copyable types), the compiler may choose to copy them directly, 
   *      which is typically very cheap.

pass by value, pass by reference:

just add '&' to the function/method parameter name to pass that parameter by reference.
void addNumber(int &a){...}
string, vectors, map, list etc all are passed by value by default therefore need to add '&'

arrays are by default passed by reference
void printArray(int arr[], int arraySize){....}

**Note : we can pass 1D array without mentioning size. But for 2D and ND array we need to specify the size.
1D : void func1(int arr[])
2D : void func2(int arr[][20])
In competetive programming we avoid passing array to function as we cannot mention the size of the array in function signature as mention above.
instead we declare array globally with max size i.e. upper bound of the constrain mentioned in the question. 
also by declaring array globally we can directly access it without passing it to function.
