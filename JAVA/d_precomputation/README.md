Two techniques for pre-computation
1. Prefix sum 2. Hashing

***** Using a fixed size array and storing count directly is also referred to as hashing eg making an array of size 26 to store count of all character in a string or making an array of size Max and storing the count of number in its respective index in array.

Factorial
Fibonacci
Occurrence of an element
Prefix sum 1d array
Prefix sum 2d array

In questions related to prefix sum it is helpful to take array indexing based on 1 instead of 0

Code chef gcd question : create two array of gcd one from forward and one from backwards

Hacker rank array manipulation question :

Imp concept which will help in medium to hard questions: instead of adding the given number in each query
Just add the given number at starting index and add negative of given number in ending index + 1. And then later when we take prefix sum will get same result


Prefix sum hard question (luv own question)

Create a 2d array with column length equality to string length and row equal to 26 i.e. number of character
Where each row will be prefix sum of count of that corresponding character
